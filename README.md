## Inspiration
Research shows that candidates who have resumes that relate specifically to the job being sought will be the first choice for an interview more often than candidates who include general objective statements.

## What it does
Resume Architect provides suggestions by comparing similarities of a job description and resume. 

## How we built it
We used natural language processing and Streamlit to build it. 

## Challenges we ran into
We tried to deploy a fully functional application, but we couldn't achieve that since hosting NLTK projects on Heroku is expensive due to storage limitations. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to highlight on PDFs 
- We were able to successfully give similarity scores to users

## What's next for Resume Architect
We plan to give job recommendations in the future by scraping LinkedIn and picking the best-suited jobs based on similarity scores.
